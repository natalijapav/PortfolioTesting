Summary: "Load More" list resets after returning from product detail page on ‘’Haljine, kombinezoni’’ page

Description: When a user clicks "Load More" on the product listing page to view additional items (‘’e.g 400 od 831 proizvoda’’), then selects a product to view its detail page and navigates back to the listing, the page does not preserve the loaded state (‘’200 od 831 proizvoda’’). Instead, it resets to the initial product list, requiring the user to click "Load More" again and search for the previously viewed position.
