Summary: "Load More" list resets after returning from product detail page on ‘’Haljine, kombinezoni’’ page

Description: When a user clicks "Load More" on the product listing page to view additional items (‘’e.g 400 od 831 proizvoda’’), then selects a product to view its detail page and navigates back to the listing, the page does not preserve the loaded state (‘’200 od 831 proizvoda’’). Instead, it resets to the initial product list, requiring the user to click "Load More" again and search for the previously viewed position. 

Environment: Desktop, Windows 10, Chrome Version 136 

Steps to reproduce:

1.Open website1.com  
2\. Go to ‘’Haljine, Vidi sve’’ category  
3.Scroll down and click the **Load More** button several times  
4.Click on product to view details  
5.Go back to the category page 

Expected result: User is redirected to the previous page with with all previously loaded products (e.g., 400 products)  

Actual result: Only part of the previously loaded products is shown (e.g., only 200 are loaded instead of 400). User has to click **Load More** again to get back to where they were.
