## Description
This document outlines proposed improvements to the e-commerce website to enhance user experience, readability, navigation, and overall visual appeal.

## Improvement 1: Product Cards (White Background)
**Current:**  
Multiple products in sections like *Ananasovi Asovi*, *Najnoviji Proizvodi*, *Izdvajamo ove nedelje* appear on a plain white background without separation. All items blend together.

**Requested:**  
Display each product in a card with light-gray background and subtle box-shadow. Add spacing between cards (e.g., Xpx).

**Reason:**  
Visual separation improves readability, scannability, and allows users to navigate and interact with product lists more easily.

## Improvement 2: Product Titles
**Current:**  
Product names are displayed in regular font, making them less prominent.

**Requested:**  
Use bold font-weight (700) for the first word of the product title and slightly increase font size.

**Reason:**  
Enhancing visual emphasis helps users quickly identify products and improves overall readability.

---

## Improvement 3: Product Navigation (Left-Right Arrows)
**Current:**  
Arrow navigation scrolls only two products at a time, even when six are visible.

**Requested:**  
Scroll by a full row/group of visible products to provide a clearer sense of progress.

**Reason:**  
Scrolling by small increments feels unintuitive; full-row scrolling improves browsing efficiency and user experience.

## Improvement 4: Subscription Section Layout (UI)
**Current:**  
Title and description are visually disconnected from the input fields on desktop; mobile layout is better.

**Requested:**  
Group title, description, and input fields in a shared container on desktop, similar to mobile layout.

**Reason:**  
Ensures consistency across devices, improves readability, and provides a better visual connection between message and action.

---

## Improvement 5: Text Formatting (UI)
**Current:**  
Text is densely packed, especially in *All Categories* sections and category descriptions.

**Requested:**  
Add headings, spacing, line-height (1.6), font size (14px), and visual emphasis to improve readability.

**Reason:**  
Better formatting enhances readability, engagement, and overall site professionalism.

---

## Improvement 6: Categories Page Layout (UI)
**Current:**  
Categories on *Sve Kategorije* page are plain text without icons/images.

**Requested:**  
Add icons or images next to each category name, positioned to the left of the text.

**Reason:**  
Visual elements help users quickly recognize categories, improve navigation, and make the page more engaging.
