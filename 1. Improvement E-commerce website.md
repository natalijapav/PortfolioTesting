# Improvement 1: **White background**

**Current:**  
 In the **Ananasovi Asovi** section, multiple products are displayed on a white background without any visual separation. All items blend together, making it look like a single block instead of clearly distinct products. This also appears in the section ‘’Najnoviji Proizvodi’’, ‘’Izdvajamo ove nedelje’’ section on Ananasovi Asovi page, ‘’Sve za bebe i decu’’ section on ‘’Ananas poklon kartica page’’.

**Requested:**  
Display each product inside a card with a light-gray background  and subtle box-shadow. Add Xpx spacing between cards to visually separate them.

**Reason:**  
 The current layout makes it difficult to distinguish individual products at a glance, which can confuse users and negatively impact usability and engagement. 

Visual separation will improve readability and help users more easily navigate and interact with the product list. Scannability makes the section more noticeable and easier to navigate. Better visual hierarchy helps direct the users focus to the most important content.

2. **Title of products**

**Current:**  
 The product names are displayed in a regular (non-bold) font, making them less prominent and easy to overlook, especially against the white background.

**Requested:**  
 Use a bold font style font-weight:700 (of the first word of the title), slightly larger size to make product names more visually distinct in product lists.

**Reason:**  
 In product listings, the names tend to blend into the background and surrounding content, making it harder for users to quickly identify individual products. Improving the visual emphasis on product names enhances readability and overall user experience.

3. **Navigating left-right (functionality)**

**Current:**  
 The arrow navigation (arrow wrapper) scrolls only two products at a time when navigating left or right through the product list, even though six products are visible at once.

**Requested:**  
 Adjust the navigation so that at least a full row/group should be displayed, instead of just two items, without overlapping.

**Reason:**  
 Scrolling only two products at a time feels unintuitive and gives the impression of minimal movement, which can confuse users and make browsing less efficient. Scrolling by a full row improves the overall user experience by providing a clearer sense of progress through the product list.

4. **UI improvement**

**Current:**  
 In the subscription section, the title ("**Budi u toku\!**") and description are positioned separately from the input fields, which appear far to the right on the desktop. This creates a visual disconnect between message and action. On the mobile version, however, the layout is much better and feels like a unified section.

**Requested:**  
 On desktop, reorganize the layout so that the title, description, and input fields are visually grouped — placed within a shared container — similar to how it appears on mobile.

**Reason:**  
Since the mobile version already provides a better experience, applying a similar layout on desktop would ensure consistency and improve usability across devices, better display of text and input form.

5. **Text (UI)**

**Current:**  
 Text across the site is densely packed without clear formatting or spacing, making it hard to read. This is most noticeable when we enter the 'All Categories' section or when viewing the description of a specific category.

**Requested:**  
 Add headings, spacing, line height, and visual emphasis to improve text layout and separate content clearly. Line-height: 1.6, font size:14

**Reason:**  
 Improved formatting enhances readability, user engagement, and overall site professionalism.

6. **UI**

**Current:**  
 In the “Sve Kategorije” page on the web version, categories are displayed as plain text without any icons or images, making the layout bland and unengaging.

**Requested:**  
 Enhance the categories list by adding icons or images alongside category names to create a more visually appealing and identifiable layout. The icon should be positioned to the left of each category name

**Reason:**  
 Adding visual elements helps users quickly recognize and differentiate categories, improving navigation and making the page more attractive and user-friendly.
